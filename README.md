A lightweight desktop tool made for **Last Letter–style word games**.  
It listens for typed prefixes, finds a matching word, and types the remaining letters instantly.

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. You type a prefix (1–4 letters)
2. The app searches `words.txt` for a matching word
3. It removes the prefix from the word
4. It types the remaining letters and presses Enter

You still control when letters are entered — this just handles the typing.
